# Svarog
QMK based firmware for my DZ60 based keyboard. I am using a non-conventional layout that is not supported by stock DZ60 firmware, hence this. Most notable differece is row 4 on svarog has one more key than DZ60.


Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    make svarog:default

See [build environment setup](https://docs.qmk.fm/build_environment_setup.html) then the [make instructions](https://docs.qmk.fm/make_instructions.html) for more information.
